Hello,
I am a student at the CV High School.  My first year of high school wasn’t the best experience at all. I am a victim of harassment, suffered fear to attend to school, and lots of emotions with it.  I didn’t want to speak up with the fear that things might had gotten worse or I will suffer a harder consequence by the one damaging me.  I decided to inform my brother about it to see if he could help me find a better solution that can make me feel less afraid of getting hurt.  Not expecting that my brothers reaction will inform the whole school about what was going on, even then I feared to say a word but, I also knew that if I speaked up I would save a lot of girls from experiencing this hell.  It’s when I took the courage to speak up for my friends and the people around me , so this feeling didn’t transtend to other girls and hurt them too.  The support the people around me gave me was what made me be stronger and to see that I wasn’t the only one after all ,was terrifying. I was also glad that when I speak up I encouraged the rest to speak up for their own good. My brother’s support was what kept me strong the most because I knew that if anything he will defend me from anyone and anything.   Yes, people don’t see me the same way like before , but let me tell you, being a victim of harassment doesn’t make neither of us victims more or less humans. We experienced things than no one in this life should, but we still feel, move, and react like any other humans just with little scars of our experiences. To the victims out there with the fear to speak up because of what else the people causing this can do to them, don’t fear because there’s people around you who love and support you, and will be able to defend you in any situation of danger. So speak up for you and for the rest because only our voice can make a change in that hell. 

Lots of love
</p>
